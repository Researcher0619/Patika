This Java program takes the user's input for the temperature, then suggests suitable activities based on the given temperature range. If the temperature is less than 5, it recommends skiing. If the temperature is between 5 and 25, it further suggests going to the cinema for temperatures below or equal to 15 and going for a picnic for temperatures greater than or equal to 10. If the temperature exceeds 25, it recommends swimming. The program uses a combination of a ternary operator and nested if statements to determine the appropriate activity based on the input temperature.
