This Java program calculates the average of lesson scores entered by the user. It validates each score to ensure it falls within the valid range of 0 to 100. If any score is outside this range, it is not included in the calculation. After calculating the average, the program provides feedback, congratulating the user if the average is 55 or higher, or suggesting to try again next year if the average is below 55. The code includes user prompts, input validation, and clear comments for readability.
