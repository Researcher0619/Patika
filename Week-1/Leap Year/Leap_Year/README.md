#Leap Year Checker

##Overview

The Leap Year Checker is a simple Java program that determines whether a given year is a leap year. Leap years have special rules for divisibility and are important in various calendar systems.

##How It Works

The program prompts the user to input a year and then checks if it meets the criteria for being a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, or it is divisible by 400.
