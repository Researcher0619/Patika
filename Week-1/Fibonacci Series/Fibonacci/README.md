 # Fibonacci Series Generator in Java

This Java program prompts the user to input the number of elements they want in the Fibonacci series. It initializes the first two numbers as 0 and 1 and iteratively generates the subsequent numbers by summing the previous two. The series is then printed, providing a clear demonstration of Fibonacci sequence generation using loops and variables in Java.
