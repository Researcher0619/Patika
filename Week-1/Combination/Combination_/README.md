# COMBINATION CALCULATION

This Java program prompts the user for values of n and r, checks for invalid input, and then calculates and displays the combination using the formula C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!). The calculateCombination function and a helper function factorial are used to simplify the code and improve readability.
