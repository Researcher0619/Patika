# Java Array Sorting

This Java program takes user input to populate an integer array and then utilizes the Bubble Sort algorithm to arrange the elements in ascending order. The user is prompted to enter the size of the array and individual elements, and the program displays the sorted array. The Bubble Sort algorithm compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, progressively moving the largest element towards its correct position. The process continues until the entire array is sorted. The code includes English comments to facilitate understanding.
