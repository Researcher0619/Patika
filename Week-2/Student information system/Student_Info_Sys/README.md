## Course Class
The Course class manages course-related details. It has a constructor for initializing the course, a method to assign a teacher to the course, and a method to print teacher information.

## How to Use
The Main class demonstrates how to create instances of these classes, assign teachers to courses, and manage student information. It serves as an entry point to run the system.

Feel free to explore the code for a basic understanding of how student, teacher, and course information is organized and managed.

### Running the Sample

To run the provided sample, execute the Main class. It showcases the interaction between students, teachers, and courses.

Note: Make sure to adjust the code or expand functionalities based on specific system requirements.
