# Recursive Rule Application
This Java program demonstrates a recursive method to apply a specified rule based on user input. The rule involves subtracting 5 from the input until reaching 0 or a negative value, and then adding 5 again. The current value is printed at each step.

Usage:

Run the program.
Enter a numerical value for N when prompted.

Example:


// User input: 16

// Output: 

16 11 6 1 -4 1 6 11 16

Note:

Ensure to provide a numerical value for a meaningful demonstration.
The program showcases a recursive approach to implement the rule efficiently.
