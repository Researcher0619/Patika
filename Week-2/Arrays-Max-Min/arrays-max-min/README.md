# Java Array Operations

This Java program takes an integer input and finds the closest smaller and larger numbers in an array.

## How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Enter an integer when prompted.
3. The program will then find the closest smaller and larger numbers in the predefined array.

## Example

Enter the number: 5

Closest number smaller than the entered number: 2

Closest number larger than the entered number: 12


## Implementation Details
The program uses a regular `for` loop to iterate through the array, finding the closest smaller and larger numbers based on the user input.

Feel free to explore and modify the code for different use cases!
