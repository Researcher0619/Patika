# File Reader and Number Summation

This Java program reads numbers from a text file and calculates their sum. The file is expected to contain one integer per line.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
2. Compile the program using a Java compiler:

    ```bash
    javac ReadFileAndSumNumbers.java
    ```

3. Run the compiled program:

    ```bash
    java ReadFileAndSumNumbers
    ```

4. The program will prompt you to enter the file path and name. Provide the path to the file you want to process.

5. The program will read the file, sum the numbers, and display the result.

## Example

Suppose the content of the file (`file.txt`) is as follows:

5

10

20


12


33


The program output will be:

Total sum of numbers read from the file: 80


## File Format

The program expects the file to contain one integer per line. Any additional content, empty lines, or non-integer values may lead to unexpected results.
